# Efficient Coding in R
Materials for MIT Political Methodology Lab workshop on efficient coding in R co-taught with [Tomoya Sasaki](https://github.com/tomoya-sasaki). 
The workshop is split into two parts. First, we will introduce the basics of computational complexity and how memory allocation works in R. With the background out of the way, we motivate and explain the advantages of vectorization using `apply` and `purrr`, and finally wrap up with an introduction to parallel processing in R using `future` through `future_apply`, `furrr`, and `foreach`.

The presentation source (RMarkdown) and PDF files are in the root folder. Since this is more of a lecture-style workshop, there are no exercises for you to do on your own.
